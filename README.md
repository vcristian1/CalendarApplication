# Calendar Application

This is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. 

When the user opens the daily planner to create a schedule the current day and time is displayed in real time at the top of the calendar. Below the time displayed, the user is presented with timeblocks for the standard business hours of 9AM-5PM. Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. Red is the current hour, Green are future hours, and Gray are past hours. When you select a time block, you
may type your desired content, and click the save button. Now the text and the hour attached to it is saved in local storage.
